        <center><h1>My special message to Ryder: You're buying subs and we all know it. Your content is so cringe for your age that I really wonder how you're still in to it. You're a liar, too. Also, I started working on this channel recently. You've had this channel for almost three years. My point is, shut up, I don't care, and grow up!
